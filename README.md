# Phoenix-Pho-Database-Project
Creating the ERD, EERD, and data model in order to create a database that could help our fictional restaurant (Phoenix Pho).

The purpose of this project was not to practice SQL, but to get a broader understanding of the steps needed to be taken in order to successfully create a stable and secure relation.
The files uploaded do not include the steps, but me and my partner spent the majority of our time creating the ERD, then the EERD, and lastly the data model.
In addition, we were tasked with writing the business model as well.
